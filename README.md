#  KPA-API (Key Performance Area Management System)

This is a simple RESTful API built using **Python** and **Flask** that allows managers to manage **Key Performance Areas (KPAs)** for employees. KPAs are used to evaluate employee performance across different measurable goals.

##  Features

-  Add a new KPA
-  View all KPAs
-  View a KPA by ID
-  Update a KPA
-  Delete a KPA

##  Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3  
- **Framework**: Flask  
- **Testing Tool**: Postman
